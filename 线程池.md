#线程池相关知识
## 线程池的简介

线程池是一个

1. 添加新线程时，如果线程未达到核心线程数则创建核心线程并运行此线程；
2. 如果已经达到核心线程且阻塞队列未满，则加入阻塞队列；
3. 如果已经达到核心线程数且阻塞队列已满，则创建额外线程并运行此线程；
4. 如果已经达到最大线程数且阻塞队列已满，则根据RejectedExecutionHandler拒绝线程加入。

## 线程池中线程的真正执行者worker

     * Checks if a new worker can be added with respect to current
     * pool state and the given bound (either core or maximum). If so,
     * the worker count is adjusted accordingly, and, if possible, a
     * new worker is created and started, running firstTask as its
     * first task. This method returns false if the pool is stopped or
     * eligible to shut down. It also returns false if the thread
     * factory fails to create a thread when asked.  If the thread
     * creation fails, either due to the thread factory returning
     * null, or due to an exception (typically OutOfMemoryError in
     * Thread.start()), we roll back cleanly.
     *
     * @param firstTask the task the new thread should run first (or
     * null if none). Workers are created with an initial first task
     * (in method execute()) to bypass queuing when there are fewer
     * than corePoolSize threads (in which case we always start one),
     * or when the queue is full (in which case we must bypass queue).
     * Initially idle threads are usually created via
     * prestartCoreThread or to replace other dying workers.
     *
     * @param core if true use corePoolSize as bound, else
     * maximumPoolSize. (A boolean indicator is used here rather than a
     * value to ensure reads of fresh values after checking other pool
     * state).

### 运行任务runWorker
```java
    /**
     * Main worker run loop.  Repeatedly gets tasks from queue and
     * executes them, while coping with a number of issues:
     *
     * 1. We may start out with an initial task, in which case we
     * don't need to get the first one. Otherwise, as long as pool is
     * running, we get tasks from getTask. If it returns null then the
     * worker exits due to changed pool state or configuration
     * parameters.  Other exits result from exception throws in
     * external code, in which case completedAbruptly holds, which
     * usually leads processWorkerExit to replace this thread.
     *
     * 2. Before running any task, the lock is acquired to prevent
     * other pool interrupts while the task is executing, and then we
     * ensure that unless pool is stopping, this thread does not have
     * its interrupt set.
     *
     * 3. Each task run is preceded by a call to beforeExecute, which
     * might throw an exception, in which case we cause thread to die
     * (breaking loop with completedAbruptly true) without processing
     * the task.
     *
     * 4. Assuming beforeExecute completes normally, we run the task,
     * gathering any of its thrown exceptions to send to afterExecute.
     * We separately handle RuntimeException, Error (both of which the
     * specs guarantee that we trap) and arbitrary Throwables.
     * Because we cannot rethrow Throwables within Runnable.run, we
     * wrap them within Errors on the way out (to the thread's
     * UncaughtExceptionHandler).  Any thrown exception also
     * conservatively causes thread to die.
     *
     * 5. After task.run completes, we call afterExecute, which may
     * also throw an exception, which will also cause thread to
     * die. According to JLS Sec 14.20, this exception is the one that
     * will be in effect even if task.run throws.
     *
     * The net effect of the exception mechanics is that afterExecute
     * and the thread's UncaughtExceptionHandler have as accurate
     * information as we can provide about any problems encountered by
     * user code.
